# Framework

A Attack and Defence framework used in ctf AWD game.

Usage:
You should edit configuration file in folder `config` first and then run:
```

Use `help` instruction to see what we support.


## CHANGE LOG 2018.6.16
To support auto completion to each command and customize each command's parameters, I decided to migrate the main framework from python native lib 'cmd' to 'python prompt toolkit'.
We keep two central parts, one is command and another is server. The command unit is used for implementation for all commands. Server unit is used for background tasks such as submitting flag.

## CHANGE LOG 2018.6.25
Migrate the framework from `cmd` to `python prompt toolkit`.
